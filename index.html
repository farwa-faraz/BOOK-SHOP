                <p>I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart, with every ounce of my being, that the Harry Potter books are among some of the most well-developed, thoroughly planned, terrifically intriguing, thought-provoking and meaningful books I have ever read. Honestly. The first movie in the Harry Potter books is certainly one of it's best, it happened to be my first exposure to the world of Harry Potter and the lifelong obsession that was about to follow.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    J.K. Rowling, whom I respect and admire profusely, has poured meaning and absolute beauty into every single word of Harry’s journey, each and every individual character and the part they have to play - for good or ill. I thoroughly recommend these books.

                <p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a successful sequel to the marvelous first book, with its own share of iconic moments and scenes. 
The book takes us farther into Harry Potter's mind, the isolation he feels from the magical world for being introduced to it ten years late into his life, while taking us deeper into the history of Hogwarts and the Dark forces surrounding it. It also properly introduces us to the divisions and the discriminations that exist in the magical world

                    The completely enthralling world of Harry Potter continues to get more exciting and more mysterious and this book delivers in such enormous ways that I never saw coming, in this wonderful masterpiece I'm introduced to another favorite character of mine that I'm proud to add to my small group of favorite characters in Harry Potter so along with Harry Potter himself and Hagrid

                <p>This was my all time favourite Harry Potter book. The characters are just amazing and I loved the story plot. I absolutely love Professor Remus Lupin he was the best teacher to teach students at Hogwarts and I would say that he is now one of my favourite characters in the series. I always loved that he teaches Harry the spell expecto patronum and he was definitely the nicest teachers ever. I mostly had to agree that the books are way better than the movies and I would highly recommend everyone to read it.

                    <br>
                    What i love about it is that it doesn't end with Voldemort attacking Harry like in the other books. At the same time, it also does include Voldemort and it gives us a back story to who really was the cause of James and Lily's death. Over all, this is an outstanding film and is great to view.

                <p>I love the whole Harry Porter world and have read the books several times, and watched some of the movies. This is a great book, the special effects, the acting, but some of the interactions in some scenes were quite awkward. I especially love the duel between 2 characters, as it is really shown how powerful both of them are. Being a fanatic of the books, I did notice that some key elements were left out. Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie dearly and would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it.

                    In the book of 'Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix'  The main character of this book is Harry Potter.In this book,new character appeared other than the 3 characters and the Order of Phoenix characters.The setting were like portrayed to the whole story,but it's really an amazing book.Some things that happened in 'Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix' is that the way that Harry Potter feels of the portrayed perfectly and the way Hermione studies frantically for her OWLs matches her character's personality so well.and the last chapters and the most eventful as always; from face to face fight  from Voldemort,a character's death,loads of revealing from the wise old Dumbledore,a bittersweet ending. I really loved the book.

                <p>Not only is this a phenomenal book, but the movie is just as great. The detail that JK put into everything just AMAZES me! I'm still trying to figure out how a  human be so smart and creative to create this world that I feel so attached to! In my opinion, the actors that were chosen for the roles were perfect. Rupert grint, Tom Felton, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and everyone else are PHENOMENAL actors. And the fact that The Sorcerer's Stone was half of the cast's first movie and they show Grammy worthy acting is unbelievable.  I totally recommend reading the books if you haven't. Not only is there even more scenes, but their is even more detail. all I have to say is BRAVO!

I love Harry Potter and hope you like it too.

                    I am speechless. harry porter is the best book in the universe. I am only 12 but I think JK rowling is the best author. the actors who played all the characters in the movie did brillient. I have always loved harry Potter. all of the movies are amazing!!!!!!!! I love Harry Potter and hope you like it too.
