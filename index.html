                <p>I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart, with every ounce of my being, that the Harry Potter books are among some of the most well-developed, thoroughly planned, terrifically intriguing, thought-provoking and meaningful books I have ever read. Honestly. The first movie in the Harry Potter books is certainly one of it's best, it happened to be my first exposure to the world of Harry Potter and the lifelong obsession that was about to follow.

                    <br>
                    J.K. Rowling, whom I respect and admire profusely, has poured meaning and absolute beauty into every single word of Harry’s journey, each and every individual character and the part they have to play - for good or ill. I thoroughly recommend these books.

                <p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a successful sequel to the marvelous first book, with its own share of iconic moments and scenes. 
The book takes us farther into Harry Potter's mind, the isolation he feels from the magical world for being introduced to it ten years late into his life, while taking us deeper into the history of Hogwarts and the Dark forces surrounding it. It also properly introduces us to the divisions and the discriminations that exist in the magical world

                    <br>
                    The completely enthralling world of Harry Potter continues to get more exciting and more mysterious and this book delivers in such enormous ways that I never saw coming, in this wonderful masterpiece I'm introduced to another favorite character of mine that I'm proud to add to my small group of favorite characters in Harry Potter so along with Harry Potter himself and Hagrid

                <p>This was my all time favourite Harry Potter book. The characters are just amazing and I loved the story plot. I absolutely love Professor Remus Lupin he was the best teacher to teach students at Hogwarts and I would say that he is now one of my favourite characters in the series. I always loved that he teaches Harry the spell expecto patronum and he was definitely the nicest teachers ever. I mostly had to agree that the books are way better than the movies and I would highly recommend everyone to read it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What i love about it is that it doesn't end with Voldemort attacking Harry like in the other books. At the same time, it also does include Voldemort and it gives us a back story to who really was the cause of James and Lily's death. Over all, this is an outstanding film and is great to view.

                <p>I love the whole Harry Porter world and have read the books several times, and watched some of the movies. This is a great book, the special effects, the acting, but some of the interactions in some scenes were quite awkward. I especially love the duel between 2 characters, as it is really shown how powerful both of them are. Being a fanatic of the books, I did notice that some key elements were left out. Otherwise, I enjoyed this movie dearly and would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it.

                    In the book of 'Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix'  The main character of this book is Harry Potter.In this book,new character appeared other than the 3 characters and the Order of Phoenix characters.The setting were like portrayed to the whole story,but it's really an amazing book.Some things that happened in 'Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix' is that the way that Harry Potter feels of the portrayed perfectly and the way Hermione studies frantically for her OWLs matches her character's personality so well.and the last chapters and the most eventful as always; from face to face fight  from Voldemort,a character's death,loads of revealing from the wise old Dumbledore,a bittersweet ending. I really loved the book.

                <p>Not only is this a phenomenal book, but the movie is just as great. The detail that JK put into everything just AMAZES me! I'm still trying to figure out how a  human be so smart and creative to create this world that I feel so attached to! In my opinion, the actors that were chosen for the roles were perfect. Rupert grint, Tom Felton, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and everyone else are PHENOMENAL actors. And the fact that The Sorcerer's Stone was half of the cast's first movie and they show Grammy worthy acting is unbelievable.  I totally recommend reading the books if you haven't. Not only is there even more scenes, but their is even more detail. all I have to say is BRAVO!

                    I am speechless. harry porter is the best book in the universe. I am only 12 but I think JK rowling is the best author. the actors who played all the characters in the movie did brillient. I have always loved harry Potter. all of the movies are amazing!!!!!!!! I love Harry Potter and hope you like it too.

                <p>The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.

                <p>Captain Underpants is back in an all-new epic adventure that's the zaniest, funniest, outrageousest, and time-travelingiest yet! When we last saw our heroes, George and Harold, they were under arrest and headed for prison. Then Harold foolishly uttered the fateful words "What could be worse than going to jail for the rest of our lives?" and changed the course of human history.

                    In this ninth epic novel, Dav Pilkey takes readers back in time to the carefree days of kindergarten, when the worst thing George and Harold had to face was not evil mad scientists or alien cafeteria ladies but a sixth-grade bully named Kipper Krupp, the nephew of their clueless school principal. And because George and Harold don't actually invent Captain Underpants until fourth grade, the two clever kindergartners are on their own, using their brains to beat the bully. Hold on to your underpants; the Captain is back!

But why, you might ask, didn't the amazing Captain Underpants save the boys from this frightening fate? Because Tippy Tinkletrousers and his time-traveling hijinks prevented George and Harold from creating Captain Underpants in the first place! Now, having changed the course of human history forever, they'll have to figure out a way to CHANGE IT BACK!

He takes them to the present where Big Tippy, Tiny Tippy and Slightly Younger Tiny Tippy is pursuing their past selves to the past. George and Harold ask why Melvin saved them by hacking into the bank's computer and defacing their surveillance photos, because in the past Melvin hated them. Melvin simply replies that 'he had his reasons'.

                    On Earth, the police were searching for George, Harold, and Mr. Krupp for robbing a bank in Book 8. However the police gave up because they couldn't find them (they had traveled back in time to the Cretaceous period) and Melvin was very happy due to the absence of George and Harold. Two weeks later though, the Turbo Toilet 2000 invaded and annoyed Melvin, who had almost completed his project. He insulted the Turbo Toilet 2000, who chased Melvin to Jerome Horwitz Elementary School where he hid in Mr. Krupp's office

He invents a machine that turns children into obedient, eager workers, trying it out first on Yesterday Harold and Yesterday George (duplicates from an earlier time-travel experiment).

                    Present-day Harold and George are horrified to see themselves and their classmates transformed by something called Attention Superfluous Lethargy Syndrome into mindlessly obedient workers. As the only children unaffected by the noxious spray, thanks to their stuffy noses Harold and George travel to the future to get help from the only adults they can trust: their future selves.

The Orcs, having heard a prophecy that a Hobbit will bear a Ring that gives universal power to its owner, wrongly think that Merry and Pippin are the Ring-bearers.

                    Several other members of the Fellowship, including Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn, resolve to pursue Merry and Pippin. They follow the hobbit's tracks through fields and forests, always on the lookout for Orcs. The group encounters the Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer.
